Seido (静動) is a small project that was created for presenting live visuals at
[Matsuura Masaya]'s live performance at Hosono Building, Osaka, 23th Dec 2017.

Some materials (original music videos, flyer images, etc.) copyrighted by
[NanaOn-Sha] are excluded but most parts of the project have been pushed to
here.

I release this work into the public domain. Feel free to reuse it for any
purpose if it's useful in some way.
